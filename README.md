# Process to model the energy consumption of a fridge

Strategy: Fridge's energy consumption is directly proportional to the time the compressor is on. Therefore, the aim is to model the length of the time the compressor is on.
Based on early impressions of the data (constrained by the time limit of 6 hours), it was decided to model the length of the time the compressor is on, based on 
1. the difference in temperatures inside the fridge when the door is opened and the temperature in the room
2. the length of time the door was open
